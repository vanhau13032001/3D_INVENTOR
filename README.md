# Miniature Steam Engine 
# Project Description
The Miniature Engine Model is a fundamental mechanical assembly designed using Autodesk Inventor. This project  as an of Autodesk Inventor's across various environments, including Part, Assembly, Presentation, and Drawing. 
## Part Environment
1. Open the "Miniature_Engine_Part.ipt" file within Autodesk Inventor's Part environment to explore the individual components of the engine.
2. Navigate through the model tree to view and modify individual parts.
3. Experiment with parametric design by adjusting dimensions and features to observe their impact on the model.

### Assembly Environment
1. Open the "Miniature_Engine_Assembly.iam" file within Autodesk Inventor's Assembly environment to observe how individual parts come together.
2. Gain insights into constraints and relationships by analyzing how the components are assembled.
3. Experiment with different arrangements and configurations of the engine for further understanding.
